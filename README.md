# ForzaSelector
This is a thing that allows you to manage your cars in Forza, like a spreadsheet but better. Also, picks a car at random for you.

You can download the latest compiled version with this handy zip
https://github.com/AmiralPatate/ForzaSelector/blob/main/_Output/ForzaSelector.zip

Unzip and profit. Do note, the zip will note override the garage file, the colors file, or the notes file. Everything else, on the other hand, will be updated.
There's a guide included in the zip, that should explain everything you need to know about the thing. And yes, this is all manual entry.
