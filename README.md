# ForzaSelector
This is a thing that allows you to manage your cars in Forza, like a spreadsheet but better. Also, picks a car at random for you.

You can download the latest compiled version with this handy zip
https://github.com/AmiralPatate/ForzaSelector/blob/main/_Output/ForzaSelector.zip

Unzip and profit.
Do note, the zip will note override the garage file, the colors file, or the notes file. Everything else, on the other hand, will be updated.
