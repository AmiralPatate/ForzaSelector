# Forza Selector for Horizon 5
Ever had 700 cars and wonder which you'll take for a spin next?

Well, this is my answer to this question, a thing that allows you to manage your cars in Forza and help you pick your next car to drive, like a spreadsheet but better. And like a spreadsheet, it's all manual entry.

To install: grab one of the zips below, unzip to wherever you please, and profit. Data files do not include user-specific files (garage file, colors file and notes file). User-specific files are not included in either zip, so you can't accidentally overwrite them.

For the full zip with data files and images, perfect for a first install, or to update the data after a game update: https://github.com/AmiralPatate/ForzaSelector/blob/main/_Output/ForzaSelector.zip

For the zip without data files or images, perfect for keeping your data as is: https://github.com/AmiralPatate/ForzaSelector/blob/main/_Output/ForzaSelector-nodata.zip

There's a guide included as part of the data files, which should explain everything you need to know about the thing, that you can also view here: https://github.com/AmiralPatate/ForzaSelector/blob/main/Common/data/Guide.pdf

Currently this only supports Forza Horizon 5 data. In the future, whenever the next Forza Motorsport comes out, I intend to support that as well.
